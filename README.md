# Chatbot

Because there isn't anything about the openfabric.pysdk on internet, I couldn't understand what you have sent and I wrote my own intent based chatbot and intents file. 


This bot can tell up to 50 different riddles and can perform basic chat with user. 


Also for further improvement as you've wanted there is a python code that can turn a pdf into xml, html or text which in that case we can use an encyclopedia to train our NLP model to enable the chatbot to answer science related questions. But obviously we have to make little changes in our training.py file.

In addition to those I've added several databases to work with and several chatbot experiments of mine.
